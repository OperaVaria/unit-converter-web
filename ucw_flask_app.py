This web application is an easy-to-use converter for historical measurement units. Its aim is
to assist both researchers and regular users with the conversion of historical units. Contrary to
other converters available on the internet, in the present project all information is derived from reliable
literature, their source is duly noted and verifiable in the unit database. The short information
notices on the interface provide the user with the basic context of the selected unit or unit system.

Currently the database features mostly unit systems connected to the historical Austria and Hungary,
as well as the Ancient Greek and Roman measurements; however any unit system can be implemented,
and their addition is continuous. All modern metric and relevant Anglo-American units are present for reference.

The application is available with both English and Hungarian interfaces.

Our project is built on the Flask web framework, with a Python backend and a conventional HTML-CSS-JS frontend.
No external website templates were utilized. The application relies greatly on the Jinja template engine in
generating the HTML pages to achieve the most optimal website coding. The localization is done with the aid of
the Flask-Babel extension, the language selection is stored in server-side sessions.

TODO: 1. Testing.
      2. Add more unit systems.
      3. Possibly add coin weights.
